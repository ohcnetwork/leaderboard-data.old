      "text": "Hello @yash-learner @Jacobjeevan, I'd like to work on this issue.\n\nProposed Fix:\n\nRemove the empty fragment `trigger={<></>}` prop at lines 266 and 280, as the trigger prop is optional and the empty fragment serves no functional purpose.\n\nImplementation:\n\n-Remove the `trigger={<></>}` prop entirely\n\n-Test the affected components to ensure functionality remains intact\n\nETA: 1 day from assignment"
