This is due to the backend expecting at least one request, and our handler only generating a request if a slot is selected.\r\n\r\nPlease advise on how you’d like to handle this scenario:\r\n- Should we create a generic appointment endpoint for \"reason for visit\" only?\r\n- Or should we require a slot selection if the appointment question is the only question in the questionnaire?\r\n"

      "text": "Hey @Jacobjeevan, the reason questionnaire submission is failing is because If the user fills only the “Reason for Visit” and skips appointment scheduling, Then slot_id is null, And our appointment getRequests() returns an empty array,\r\nWhich causes the POST /batch_requests/ to fail with a 400 error.\r\n\r\nDo we have (or can we add) a backend fallback that allows submission even if no appointment is scheduled? For example: Either by accepting empty requests gracefully as a no-op, Or by having a separate request that stores just the reason_for_visit without requiring slot_id."

Without unique IDs, React cannot properly track and update the selected state for each repeated option, causing selection to break.\n- Ensure that every answer option (and every repeated answer instance) has a unique id property.\n- implement this by generating unique ID using crypto.randomUUID or similar methods to ensure Use this id as the React key and for tracking selection.\n\nETA : Tuesday \n"
