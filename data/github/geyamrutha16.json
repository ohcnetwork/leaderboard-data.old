      "text": "@rithviknishad @Jacobjeevan @Janetmaria I'd like to work on this issue. \n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nTo prevent future dates from being selected in the **Authored On** field within medication requests, I'll:\n\n1. **Update the `DateTimeInput.tsx` component**:\n   - Add a `max` attribute to the input field.\n   - Dynamically set its value to the current datetime using `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 16)` (if the input type is `datetime-local`).\n   \n<img width=\"389\" height=\"221\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd368742-855a-4131-babd-abed61314396\" />\n\n2. **Add validation logic** in the form submit handler to prevent submission if a future date is detected, even via dev tools tampering.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Ensure the max datetime is correctly rendered.\n   - Try selecting a future date manually and verify that it's blocked.\n\n**Expected Timeline:**\n\n- **ETA**: 1 day after assignment.\n\nLet me know if this approach looks good. Looking forward to contributing!\n"

I've made the following changes to address this:\n\n### Change Made:\n- Disabled the default browser focus outline by adding `outline-none focus:outline-none`.\n- Ensured a consistent border style on focus using `focus-visible:ring-0` and `focus:border-primary-400` (for brand consistency).\n- Applied this fix in the `Input`.\n\nETA: 1 Day\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c37456-afca-4e54-b845-09d2e8214f5c\n\nCan you please assign this issue to me?"
