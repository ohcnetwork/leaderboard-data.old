      "text": "@abhimanyurajeesh @amjithtitus09 \n\n  Just thoughts \n\n - Currently, the only editable field for an already submitted field is notes, every other field it non-editable. So I think directly editing from collapsible makes sense than opening the sheet from collapsible by clicking edit and then scrolling and finding the notes field and clicking Done again.\n\n- But for not already submitted, we can edit all the fields \n\n\n\n  The expected flow is like filing all the fields and clicking Done in sheet, here I feel if they want to edit a single field it much easier to edit directly from collapsible input with a single click.\n\n   Whereas the using sheet in edit flow as well like makes two clicks → Opening sheet by clicking edit then scroll and find the field they would like to edit. But this is like providing the same UI \n\nIt's a choice we need to make, number of clicks vs using same UI\n\n🤔"
