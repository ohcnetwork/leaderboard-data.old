      "text": "Thanks for the clarification!\n\nI've updated the component to use the existing translation keys in en.json by prepending resource_status__ to the status value before passing it to the t() function.\n\n### the Implementation:\n```tsx\n<TableCell>\n  {getStatusBadge(t(`resource_status__${request.status}`))}\n</TableCell>\n```\n\nThis ensures that all status values, including transfer_in_progress and transportation_to_be_arranged , are now displayed as properly translated labels instead of raw keys.\n\nTested and working as expected. ✅\n\nTagging @rithviknishad @Jacobjeevan  I believe this issue can now be assigned to me.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d33304-b465-49ba-beb1-77e71e87e6b1)"

      "text": "THE APPROACH:\n\nThere is an inconsistency in how status values are displayed in the Resource Requests table. While the status \"approved\" appears correctly as \"Approved\", other statuses like \"transfer_in_progress\" and \"transportation_to_be_arranged\" are displayed as raw keys.\n\nRoot Cause:\nThese specific status keys (\"transfer_in_progress\", \"transportation_to_be_arranged\", etc.) are missing from the en.json translation file, so the t() function returns the raw key instead of a user-friendly, translated string.\n\nETA: TODAY\n\n@rithviknishad "
